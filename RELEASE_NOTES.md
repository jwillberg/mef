# Release notes

## Unreleased
- Fix journald program prefilter matching so rules like `programs=sshd` also match derived program names such as `sshd-session` (and similarly `postfix/smtpd` with `programs=postfix`) in `journal_mode=all`.
- Add wildcard support for journal program filters (`programs=sshd*`, `programs=postfix/*`) and fix `programs=*` handling so failregex compilation is not skipped.

## v1.0.0 - 2026-01-29
- Initial public release
